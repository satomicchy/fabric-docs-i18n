"The Fabric documentation is written in a combination of "
"[Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) and "
"[reStructuredText](http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html), and as a "
"new author you can use either or both.  We recommend you use Markdown as "

"in Python, you may prefer to use RST."

"a GitHub hook for the main [Fabric "
