"Application developers can use the Fabric tutorials to get started "
"building their own solutions. Start working with Fabric by deploying the "
"`test network <./test_network.html>`_ on your local machine. You can then"
" use the steps provided by the :doc:`deploy_chaincode` tutorial to deploy"
" and test your smart contracts. The :doc:`write_first_app` tutorial "
"provides an introduction to how to use the APIs provided by the Fabric "
"SDKs to invoke smart contracts from your client applications. For an in "
"depth overview of how Fabric applications and smart contracts work "
"together, you can visit the :doc:`developapps/developing_applications` "

"operators and application developers can use the tutorials on `Private "
"data <./private_data_tutorial.html>`_ and `CouchDB "
"<./couchdb_tutorial.html>`_ to explore important Fabric features. When "
"you are ready to deploy Hyperledger Fabric in production, see the guide "
